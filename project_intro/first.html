      <h2>Problem Space</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>1. Traffic Management</h3>
        <p>Maintenance of traffic is a significant issue, possibly due to lack of proper infrastructure, planning, or monitoring.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> Poor traffic management reflects inadequate urban planning. Designing better road networks, smart traffic systems, and public transport alternatives can alleviate congestion.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> Implementing intelligent traffic management systems or public-private partnerships for infrastructure development can create opportunities for investment.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>2. Tax System</h3>
        <p>Undecided or unclear tax policies are impacting public services and infrastructure development.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> This indicates a lack of fiscal planning. Transparent and fair taxation policies linked to urban development goals are essential.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> A clear tax regime supports investments in real estate, businesses, and public amenities.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>3. Public Transportation</h3>
        <p>Metro directions are not well-designed, leading to inefficiencies in travel routes and connectivity.</p>
        <p>Unavailability of school buses affects studentsâ€™ daily commute and access to education.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> Poorly planned metro routes show a disconnect between design and user needs. Ensuring connectivity to key areas like schools, offices, and residential zones is crucial.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> Improving public transportation attracts commuters, reduces private vehicle dependency, and boosts local commerce.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>4. Water Supply</h3>
        <p>Insufficient or inconsistent water supply affects residents' daily needs and quality of life.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> Insufficient or inconsistent water supply highlights weak resource management and infrastructure.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> Projects in water conservation, supply chain management, and smart water systems could address this issue.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>5. Waste Management</h3>
        <p>Poor waste management causes pollution and health issues, highlighting a need for better waste disposal systems.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> Inefficient systems contribute to pollution and health risks. Sustainable waste disposal mechanisms should be a priority.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> Investing in recycling plants, waste-to-energy systems, or smart bins could generate revenue and reduce ecological impact.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>6. Green Spaces</h3>
        <p>Few green areas contribute to poor air quality and reduce the city's natural beauty, impacting environmental health.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> A lack of greenery reduces quality of life and impacts air quality. Urban planners need to prioritize green zones.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> Developers can create eco-friendly housing with parks and gardens as selling points.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>7. Healthcare Services</h3>
        <p>Shortage of ambulances puts lives at risk during medical emergencies.</p>
        <div class="design-perspective">
          <strong>Design Perspective:</strong> Insufficient emergency response resources reflect poorly on health infrastructure.
        </div>
        <div class="business-case">
          <strong>Business Case:</strong> Healthcare companies can step in to expand ambulance services or offer app-based emergency solutions.

      <h2>How This Problem Space Was Arrived At</h2>
      <p>The issues appear to be identified through an analysis of critical urban needs and infrastructure challenges. These might be derived from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Observations of common urban problems.</li>
        <li>Feedback or complaints from residents.</li>
        <li>Evaluations of basic public services (transport, waste management, healthcare, etc.).</li>
        <li>A focus on sustainability and livability factors like green spaces and air quality.</li>
