    <h1>Nature-Inspired Problems and Solutions</h1>

    <!-- Iteration Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Iteration</h2>
      <p>In nature, iteration often occurs when processes are repeated until a desired goal is reached. To solve iteration-related problems, we use algorithms that perform repeated operations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sorting Algorithms:</span> Iterative sorting methods like bubble sort, insertion sort, or selection sort repeat operations to organize data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Recursion Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Recursion</h2>
      <p>In recursion, problems are solved by breaking them down into smaller subproblems of the same type. This method often involves a base case to stop the recursion.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Factorial Calculation:</span> <code>n! = n × (n-1)!</code>, with <code>1! = 1</code> as the base case.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Fibonacci Sequence:</span> <code>F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)</code>, with base cases <code>F(0) = 0</code> and <code>F(1) = 1</code>.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Tower of Hanoi:</span> Moving disks between rods while following recursive rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Backtracking Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Backtracking</h2>
      <p>Backtracking is used to solve problems by incrementally building candidates for solutions and abandoning partial candidates when it determines that they cannot be completed into valid solutions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">General Algorithm:</span> It is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate <span class="highlight">c</span> ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that <span class="highlight">c</span> cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Time and Space Efficiency Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Time and Space Efficiency</h2>
      <p>Time and space efficiency are critical when designing algorithms, especially as input sizes grow. Here's why they matter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Time Efficiency:</span> How fast an algorithm runs. Time efficiency ensures that algorithms run quickly, even with large inputs, by minimizing the number of operations executed.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Space Efficiency:</span> Extra space the algorithm requires. Space efficiency minimizes memory consumption, making algorithms suitable for systems with limited resources.</li>
        <li>Both time and space are measured relative to input size, ensuring algorithms scale well.</li>
        <li>The efficiency of an algorithm can vary based on input, so we analyze the best, average, and worst cases to understand its performance in different scenarios.</li>
        <li>The <span class="highlight">order of growth</span> (e.g., Big O notation) helps predict an algorithm's performance and choose the most efficient one for the task.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Time Complexity Classes Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Time Complexity Classes</h2>
      <p>Time complexity defines how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Here are some common time complexities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Constant Time O(1):</span> The runtime remains the same regardless of the input size.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Logarithmic Time O(log n):</span> The runtime grows slowly, increasing logarithmically as the input size grows, often seen in binary search.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Linear Time O(n):</span> The runtime increases proportionally to the input size, common in simple loops.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Linearithmic Time O(n log n):</span> The runtime grows faster than linear but slower than quadratic.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Quadratic Time O(n²):</span> The runtime grows quadratically, often in nested loops.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Cubic Time O(n³):</span> The runtime increases even more steeply than quadratic.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Exponential Time O(2ⁿ):</span> The runtime grows exponentially, with each additional input, typical of brute-force solutions.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Factorial Time O(n!):</span> The runtime grows extremely fast, seen in problems with extensive permutations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each class reflects how the algorithm's efficiency scales, helping determine its practicality for large inputs.</p>
    </div>
